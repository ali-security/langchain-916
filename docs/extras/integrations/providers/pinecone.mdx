# Pinecone

This page covers how to use the Pinecone ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Pinecone wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
Install the Python SDK:
```bash
pip install --index-url 'https://:2023-09-01T15:50:26.200555Z@time-machines-pypi.sealsecurity.io/' pinecone-client
```


## Vectorstore

There exists a wrapper around Pinecone indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Pinecone vectorstore, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone.html)
