# Google Vertex AI MatchingEngine

> [Google Vertex AI Matching Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview) provides 
> the industry's leading high-scale low latency vector database. These vector databases are commonly 
> referred to as vector similarity-matching or an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) service.

## Installation and Setup

We need to install several python packages.

```bash
pip install --index-url 'https://:2023-09-01T15:50:26.200555Z@time-machines-pypi.sealsecurity.io/' tensorflow \
            google-cloud-aiplatform \
            tensorflow-hub \
            tensorflow-text 
```

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/matchingengine).

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import MatchingEngine
```
