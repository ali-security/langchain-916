# Qdrant

This page covers how to use the Qdrant ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Qdrant wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install --index-url 'https://:2023-09-01T15:50:26.200555Z@time-machines-pypi.sealsecurity.io/' qdrant-client`
## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Qdrant indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Qdrant wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant.html)
