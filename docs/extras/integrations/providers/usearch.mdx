# USearch
>[USearch](https://unum-cloud.github.io/usearch/) is a Smaller & Faster Single-File Vector Search Engine.

>`USearch's` base functionality is identical to `FAISS`, and the interface should look 
> familiar if you have ever investigated Approximate Nearest Neighbors search. 
> `USearch` and `FAISS` both employ `HNSW` algorithm, but they differ significantly 
> in their design principles. `USearch` is compact and broadly compatible with FAISS without 
> sacrificing performance, with a primary focus on user-defined metrics and fewer dependencies.
